Before playing the game, run the external tool. One way is by opening the project in Visual Studio and setting ExternalTool to 
StartUp Project. Check the checkboxes you want, then press "Run Game!". This saves the data to the file.
If you have startup issues because the test computer doesn't have OpenAL, there should be an installer for it in here. The sound uses OpenAL and it explodes if those drivers
are missing.
Game - Press enter to go from the main menu to the game. Use WASD to move. Press E to "interact" with objects. Press Tab to open the phone
menu. Press LeftShift to close it and numbers 1-4 to navigate between screens, 1 and 2 have art assets done but 3 and 4 don't. Tab returns you to the main phone screen.
