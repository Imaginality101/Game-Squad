    // Needs to have a way of tracking which menu item it's on, we may also need a more categorical version of this class to hold other menus
    // If the player hits whatever the method of selection is, it should call an Open() method of the menu item highlighted
    // The menu view itself also needs a property and attribute to check if it's enabled, as well as an Open method for itself which toggles that on/Close method for off
    // Other than the main view of the phone itself and maybe settings, menus should use lists for content since as the player finds clues they go there
